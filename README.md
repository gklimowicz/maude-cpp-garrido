# Introduction

This repository contains the Maude code from the paper Algebraic Semantics of the C Preprocessor and Correctness of its Refactorings Alejandra Garrido, José Meseguer, and Ralph Johnson.

This repository also contains the Maude specification from Alejandra Garrido&rsquo;s Ph.D. thesis.

I haven&rsquo;t dug into these yet to identify the differences.
